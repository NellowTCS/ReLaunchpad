# ReLaunchpad

This is very unstable, and icons are rather broken! Use at your own risk. 

## Quick start

1. ### Install dependencies

   - Node & npm (recommended latest LTS)
   - Rust + cargo (stable)
   - Tauri prerequisites (macOS: Xcode command line tools, etc.)

1. ### From project root

   ```bash
   cd Build
   npm install
   npm run tauri:dev
   ```
